# Haunted-House

Haunted House is a project that I created in 2018 for my Computer Graphics course. It consists of a thematic house with two separate rooms: one related to the well-known Mexican tradition "Day of the death", and the second one with halloween decoration.   
   
It was created using C++ OpenGL libraries. [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/about/) is the premier environment for developing portable, interactive 2D and 3D graphics applications. Since its introduction in 1992, OpenGL has become the industry's most widely
used and supported 2D and 3D graphics application programming interface (API), bringing thousands of applications to a wide variety of computer platforms. OpenGL fosters innovation and speeds application development by incorporating a broad set of rendering,
texture mapping, special effects, and other powerful visualization functions. Developers can leverage the power of OpenGL across all popular desktop and workstation platforms, ensuring wide application deployment.

**.h** are header files   
**.cpp** are C++ source files

If you'd like to run the project, you need to download all the 6 files above and include them in your project. Due to the size of images, textures are not included in this repository so you would need to find and download them yourself.   
This project was originally created and tested using [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/vs/older-downloads/).
